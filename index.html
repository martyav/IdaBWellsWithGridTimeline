            <p>
                Ida B. Wells was a Black journalist, public speaker, and activist. Born slightly before the Emancipation Proclamation, Wells
                dedicated her life to fighting racism and sexism in the United States. She was especially vocal about the
                lynchings which killed many Black men throughout the country.
            </p>
            <p>
                Wells started her career as a teacher at the tender age of 16, after a yellow fever outbreak left her family orphaned. She
                soon moved to Memphis, took college classes, and began writing for local papers under the pen name, "Iola".
                Even as a young woman, Wells frequently stood up for herself against bigots.
            </p>
            <p>
                At 22, she sued The Chesapeake, Ohio &amp; Southwestern Railroad Company when they tried to force her to move to make way for
                white passengers. She won her case in the lower courts, but the state Supreme Court overturned the ruling
                and made her pay court costs. Her newspaper articles criticizing segregated schooling eventually led to her
                being fired as a teacher, but by that point, she was already well into her career as a journalist.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 1892, her friend Thomas Moss, a successful Black business owner, was lynched by a mob of angry white Memphis residents.
                Wells used her position as a journalist to urge Black residents to leave, resulting in an exodus of 6,000.
                In response, the offices of the newspaper she co-owned,
                <em>Free Speech And Headlight</em>, were destroyed. Wells published a study on lynchings entitled
                <em>Southern Horrors</em>, and moved to Chicago, where she continued writing.
            </p>
            <p>
                Wells toured extensively in both the U.S. and Europe, campaigning against lynching and segregation. She was also active in
                the women's suffrage movement, and critical of white feminist leaders who participated in anti-black racism.
                For example, during an overseas tour, she feuded with Frances Willard, a white American feminist who blamed
                Black men for the failure of the temperance movement.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 1913, she attended the Woman Suffrage Parade, a large protest in Washington, D.C. Black women were told to march in the
                back, but Wells refused, and marched right alongside other members of the Illinois contingent. She had founded
                the Alpha Suffrage Club of Chicago earlier that year.
            </p>
            <p>
                During her later years, Wells stopped touring in order to raise her children. However, she remained active in local politics,
                and there is a
                <a href="http://www.idabwellsmonument.org">campaign</a> to have a monument built in her honor in Chicago.
